/*
 These macros allow you to wrap a class that implements the delegate pattern, such that it may accept multiple delegates.
 The resulting code-generated class will wrap an instance of the original class, forwarding method calls to that object,
 as well as forwarding all delegate method calls to its own list of delegates.
 
 The new class will provide the following additional API for delegate subscriptions:
 
 - (void) subscribeDelegate:(id<DELEGATE_PROTOCOL>) delegate
 - (void) unsubscribeDelegate:(id<DELEGATE_PROTOCOL>) delegate

 Modifying the delegate property of the original object will be captured via KVO. The code-generated class will maintain
 consistent state between itself and the original object.
